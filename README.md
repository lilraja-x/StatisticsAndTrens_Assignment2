# Data Visualization Summary

## 1. Customer Count by Contract Type  
This bar chart represents the distribution of customers based on their contract type. It shows that most customers prefer a **month-to-month** contract, while fewer opt for **one-year** or **two-year** contracts, suggesting a preference for flexibility.

## 2. Customer Location vs. Churn Score  
This scatter plot visualizes customer locations based on **poistion(latitude and longitude)**, with color representing **churn score**. Higher churn scores (red) and lower churn scores (blue) indicate regional differences in customer retention trends.

## 3. Correlation Heatmap  
The heatmap illustrates the correlation between various numerical features in the dataset. Strong positive and negative correlations highlight relationships, such as the **strong correlation between latitude and zip code** and the **moderate correlation between churn score and churn value**.
